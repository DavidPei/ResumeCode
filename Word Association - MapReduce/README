"For this project, you're finally going to roll up your sleeves and use MapReduce to answer a big data problem. The question you're going to answer is this: given a word, what other words are statistically associated with it? If I say 'love', or 'death', or 'terrorism', what other words and concepts go with it?"
"Your task is to produce an ordered list of words for the target word sorted by generalized co-occurrence rate, ordered with the biggest co-occurrence rates at the top. The data will be the same data we used in labs 2 and 3. This isn't the most sophisticated text-analysis algorithm out there, but it's enough to illustrate what you can do with MapReduce."
